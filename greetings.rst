I felt like I needed a place to write some thoughts and views of
programming. So, I decided to create a blog. I was going to write a
wiki-style site in Scala but since my free time is awfully limited, it
would have taken years =) Well, I do have such a site for sharing some
events from the lives of my two boys, but the functionality is quite
limited...

I hope I can find the time to write something every now and then.
Currently I'm experimenting with how Scala could be used for LINQ-style
abstract queries, of which I hope to write something soon. There is
already a similar project called ScalaQuery, but I didn't like some of
the approaches that it seemed to take so I decided to write my own =).
There's also a paper called ScalaQL, which I haven't read yet, but I
suspect I have re-invented some of the same wheels. Might be wrong
though...
